## Sukuma SBR - Self Balancing Robot Experiments

Build in progress...



Sukuma means "stand up" in Zulu. This project is a way for me to learn and practically implement the following electronic components and concepts:

- Bipolar stepper motors
- Unipolar stepper motors
- MPU6050 IMU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer)
- PID Control
- Arduino Interrupts
- Using millis() instead of delay()
