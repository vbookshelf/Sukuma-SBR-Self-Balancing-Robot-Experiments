### Objective

Build a circuit and Arduno sketch to run two 28BYJ-48 unipolar stepper motors. 

### Notes

There are two Arduino sketches. The first one runs one motor at a time. The second runs both motors at the same time.

### Lessons Learned

- It's possible to run both motors using a 6V supply.
- Going from a 6V supply to a 10V supply allows the motor speed to be increased.
