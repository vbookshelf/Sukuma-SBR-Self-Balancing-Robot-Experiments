## Sukuma - Self Balancing Robot Experiments
Sukuma means "stand up" in Zulu. This repo contains my experiments with Sukuma-1, a self balancing robot I built at home. This project is a way for me to learn and practically implement the following electronic components and concepts:

- Bipolar stepper motors
- Unipolar stepper motors
- MPU6050 IMU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer)
- PID Control
- Arduino Interrupts

### Lessons Learned

- A craft shop is a good place to source materials for a robot because you can be buy MDF board and other bits and pieces in small quantities. I made the wheels by sticking two MDF coasters together with super glue and then drilling a hole through the center. The hole is 0.5mm less than the diameter of the motor shaft. This allowed the wheel to be press fit onto the motor shaft.
