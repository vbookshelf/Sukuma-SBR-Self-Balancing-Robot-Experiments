## Sukuma - Self Balancing Robot Experiments
Sukuma means "stand up" in Zulu. This repo contains my experiments with Sukuma-1, a self balancing robot I built at home. This project is a way for me to learn and practically implement the following electronic components and concepts:

- Bipolar stepper motors
- Unipolar stepper motors
- MPU6050 IMU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer)
- PID Control
- Arduino Interrupts

In progress...
