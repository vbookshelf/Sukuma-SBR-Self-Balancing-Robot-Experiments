### Objective

Build a simple circuit and Arduno sketch to test the 28BYJ-48 unipolar stepper motor and the ULN2003 driver.

### Notes

Please refer the the attached pdf file: Notes 28BYJ48 Stepper Motor.pdf

### Lessons Learned

- Stepper motors can move very slowly without needing to add gears.
- The 28BYJ-48 runs very quietly.
- This stepper motor is cheap and is easy to run.

This tutorial by Modest Maker shows how to control the stepper
motor without using a library. He shows animations that clearly show
the sequence in which the coils are activated.<br>
