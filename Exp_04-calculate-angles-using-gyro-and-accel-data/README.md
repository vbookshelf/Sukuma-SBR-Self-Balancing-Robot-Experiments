### Objective
Use data from the MPU6050 gyro and accelerometer to calculate pitch and roll angles. Display these angles on the serial monitor.

### Notes

1- I removed the LCD code from the sketches created by Dronebot Workshop and Joop Brokking. This makes their code easier to follow.

2- I also created a sketch to get the MPU6050 data using the Jeff Rowberg library.

3- This experiment was not successful. I could not get stable values for the angles as shown in the videos by Dronebot Workshop and Joop Brokking. I suspect that there could be a problem with the MPU6050 that I'm using. This issue could be caused by bad soldering on the hearder pins.
